## INSURANCE POLICIES ANALYSIS REPORT
## 1. Statement of the Problem
The insurance industry faces challenges in identifying key risk factors that influence claim frequency and average claim value. Understanding how demographics, marital status, education, income distribution, car use, and regional distribution affect insurance claims is essential for making data-driven decisions. This analysis aims to uncover trends in customer segmentation, claim patterns, and income-to-claim ratios to optimize policy pricing and risk assessment.

## 2. Key Insights from the Dashboard
- Demographics and Insurance Claims
The highest percentage of insured individuals falls in the 40-49 age band, with fairly balanced gender representation across age groups.
- Married individuals make up the majority (41.3%) of policyholders, while single individuals account for 33.48%.
- Higher education levels correlate with a higher number of insured individuals, with Bachelor's and High School graduates leading.
## Claim Frequency and Average Claim by Car Model
- Claim Frequency:
A significant portion (72.46%) of policyholders have not made any claims.
- Only 15.75% have made one claim, while claim frequency drastically drops for individuals making multiple claims.
## Average Claim by Car Model:
- The highest average claims are seen for the Crossfire Roadster (99K) and Truck Xtracab SR5 (89K), indicating that these vehicle models might have a higher risk or repair cost.
## Income and Claims Distribution
- High-Income Earners generate the most total income (3.8bn) and have the highest total claims (0.9bn).
- Middle-Income Earners have a total income of 1.7bn and total claims of 0.9bn, showing a similar claim ratio to high-income earners.
- Low-Income Earners have negligible total income and claims, implying fewer insured individuals in this category.
## Insurance Claim by Car Use and Household Income Band
Private and Commercial Vehicle Claims:
- Private and commercial vehicle users have similar claim percentages, with commercial vehicles slightly higher in claims for middle-income earners (34.61%).
- Regional Distribution of High-Risk Clients:
Clients with above-average insurance claims and lower-middle-class income are concentrated in highly rural (34), urban (33), suburban (27), and rural (26) areas.

## 3. Conclusion
The analysis highlights key trends affecting insurance claims.

Married individuals, middle-income earners, and bachelor's degree holders make up a significant portion of policyholders.
Claim frequency is relatively low, but certain car models tend to have higher average claim values.
High-income and middle-income earners contribute significantly to total income and claims, with a more balanced claim-to-income ratio.
Regions with a high concentration of clients making above-average claims require further risk assessment and potential premium adjustments.
Recommendation: Insurance companies should refine their risk assessment models, adjust pricing for high-risk vehicle models, and create targeted education campaigns for rural and urban policyholders with high claim tendencies.
